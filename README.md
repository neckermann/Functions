# Functions

Here are some of the functions I have put together to make my life a bit easier. I hope the help you as well.

Remove-BuiltInWindowsApps

This function will help you clean up a Online windows installation of a remote or local computer. It will collect a list of all the built in apps and prompt you if you would like to remove them from the system. You are prompted Y/N for each application that it finds.
